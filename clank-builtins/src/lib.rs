//! clank-builtins — execution scope metadata and clank-owned builtin commands.
//!
//! This crate owns the `ExecutionScope` classification, the `CommandManifest`
//! type, and the static manifest registry for all commands clank recognises.
//! Future clank-owned builtin implementations live here alongside the metadata.

/// The execution scope of a command, as defined in the clank architecture.
///
/// Every command resolvable by the shell has exactly one scope. Scope
/// determines routing, state-mutation rights, and AI tool-surface eligibility.
